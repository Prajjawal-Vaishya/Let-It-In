Let It In
"Silence is your only weapon. The AI is listening."

1. About The Project
Let It In is an immersive psychological survival game that blurs the line between player and protagonist. Unlike traditional horror games, this project utilizes real-time audio input and adaptive AI to create a responsive environment where your physical reactions dictate your survival.

Designed to test critical thinking under pressure, the game forces players to solve complex psychological puzzles while being hunted by a custom-made AI entity. It serves not only as a game but as a simulation tool for high-stress scenarios, such as defense training or escape strategies.

2. Key Features
🧠 Psychological & Critical Thinking
Mind-Bending Puzzles: Navigate through a labyrinth of psychological traps designed to improve critical thinking and situational awareness.

High-Stakes Escape: Scenarios modeled after real-life danger (e.g., child abduction escape) teach players to think clearly when panic sets in.

🎙️ Immersive Audio & AI Mechanics
Real-Time Breath Detection: The game utilizes a sophisticated audio input system that monitors your microphone. If you breathe too loudly or make a sound in real life, the AI will hear you.

Dynamic Heartbeat System: The in-game heartbeat audio intensifies and beats harder as the entity approaches, simulating an adrenaline spike and serving as a proximity warning.

"Only AI Can Open Doors": A unique mechanic where physical progression is locked behind AI interaction. You cannot force your way through; you must outsmart the system.

3. Powered by GenAI
This project leverages cutting-edge Generative AI to create a non-repetitive, organic experience:

Dialogue by Gemini: The narrative structure, lore, and dynamic dialogue options are powered by Google Gemini, ensuring that the story adapts and feels intellectually challenging.

Voices by ElevenLabs: The antagonist and environmental voices are generated using ElevenLabs, delivering hyper-realistic, emotive, and terrifyingly human-like audio that reacts to the player's presence.

4. Real-World Applications
Beyond entertainment, this engine is designed with serious simulation capabilities:

Defense & Tactical Training: Can be used as a sound system simulation for defense sectors, training personnel to maintain noise discipline in hostile environments.

Safety Simulations: serves as an educational tool for scenarios like kidnap escape, teaching users how to remain calm and quiet while seeking exit strategies in hostile confinement.

5. Technical Highlights
Input: Microphone (Real-time amplitude analysis for breath/noise detection).

AI Engine: Custom-built behavior trees for the antagonist.

APIs: ElevenLabs (TTS), Google Gemini (LLM).
